# misc_tools
### This repository contains miscellaneous tools for machine learning.

**uar_loss_pytorch.py** contains a custom UAR (unweighted average recall, also known as unweighted accuracy) loss function to directly optimize a neural network using UAR as the loss metric. This implementation is created for the PyTorch deep learning library. The code also includes a small test script with randomly generated data to test out the function with PyTorch.

**uar_loss_tensorflow.py** contains a custom UAR (unweighted average recall, also known as unweighted accuracy) loss function to directly optimize a neural network using UAR as the loss metric. This implementation is created for the TensorFlow deep learning library. The code also includes a small test script with randomly generated data to test out the function with TensorFlow.

**plot_confusion_matrix.py** plots a nice-looking confusion matrix using Python (+ LaTeX if selected).
